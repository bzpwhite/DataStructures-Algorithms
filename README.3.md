# Stack

In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves 
as a collection of elements, with two principal operations:

* **push**, which adds an element to the collection, and
* **pop**, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.

The order in which elements come off a stack gives rise to its 
alternative name, LIFO (last in, first out). Additionally, a 
peek operation may give access to the top without modifying 
the stack. The name "stack" for this type of structure comes 
from the analogy to a set of physical items stacked on top of 
each other, which makes it easy to take an item off the top 
of the stack, while getting to an item deeper in the stack 
may require taking off multiple other items first

# 栈

栈（stack）又名堆栈，它是一种运算受限的线性表。其限制是仅允许在表的一端进行插入和删除运算。这一端被称为栈顶，相对地，把另一端称为栈底。向一个栈插入新元素又称作进栈、入栈或压栈，它是把新元素放到栈顶元素的上面，使之成为新的栈顶元素；从一个栈删除元素又称作出栈或退栈，它是把栈顶元素删除掉，使其相邻的元素成为新的栈顶元素。
