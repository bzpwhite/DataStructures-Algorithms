# Graph

In computer science, a graph is an abstract data type 
that is meant to implement the undirected graph and 
directed graph concepts from mathematics, specifically
the field of graph theory

A graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly 
mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points, together 
with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an 
undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a 
directed graph. These pairs are known as edges, arcs, 
or lines for an undirected graph and as arrows, 
directed edges, directed arcs, or directed lines 
for a directed graph. The vertices may be part of 
the graph structure, or may be external entities 
represented by integer indices or references.

# 图

图（Graph）是表示物件与物件之间的关系的数学对象，是图论的基本研究对象。一个不带权图中若两点不相邻，邻接矩阵相应位置为0，对带权图(网)，相应位置为∞。
对于一个拥有n个顶点的无向连通图，它的边数一定多于n-1条。若从中选择n-1条边，使得无向图仍然连通，则由n个顶点及这 n-1条边（弧）组成的图被称为原无向图的生成树。
